# Daniela Sánchez - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About me
Hola! I'm Daniela, a civil engineer with a master's degree and a certification in Data Analysis.

Throughout my career, I have been recognized for my analytical mindset and meticulous attention to detail. 
Even before officially stepping into the data analysis field, 
I consistently utilized various tools to create comprehensive tables and charts that effectively communicated complex data insights. 
My strong motivation and love for learning have equipped me with a robust understanding of data manipulation and visualization.

In this repository, you can see my projects as a Data Analyst.

Here you can find my [CV](https://github.com/danisan918/portfolio/blob/main/CV%20DATA%20ANALYST.pdf.)

Thank you for stopping by.
